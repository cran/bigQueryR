\title{Convert date-sharded tables to a single partitioned table}
\usage{
bqr_partition(sharded, partition, projectId = bqr_get_global_project(),
  datasetId = bqr_get_global_dataset())
}
\arguments{
\item{sharded}{The prefix of date-sharded tables to merge into one partitioned table}

\item{partition}{Name of partitioned table. Will create if not present already}

\item{projectId}{The project ID}

\item{datasetId}{The dataset ID}
}
\value{
A list of copy jobs for the sharded tables that will be copied to one partitioned table
}
\description{
Moves the old style date-sharded tables such as \code{[TABLE_NAME]_YYYYMMDD} to the new date partitioned format.
}
\details{
Performs lots of copy table operations via \link{bqr_copy_table} 

Before partitioned tables became available, BigQuery users would often divide 
  large datasets into separate tables organized by time period; usually daily tables, 
  where each table represented data loaded on that particular date.
  
Dividing a dataset into daily tables helped to reduce the amount of data scanned 
  when querying a specific date range. For example, if you have a a year's worth of data 
  in a single table, a query that involves the last seven days of data still requires 
  a full scan of the entire table to determine which data to return. 
  However, if your table is divided into daily tables, you can restrict the query to 
  the seven most recent daily tables.
  
Daily tables, however, have several disadvantages. You must manually, or programmatically, 
  create the daily tables. SQL queries are often more complex because your data can be 
  spread across hundreds of tables. Performance degrades as the number of referenced 
  tables increases. There is also a limit of 1,000 tables that can be referenced in a 
  single query. Partitioned tables have none of these disadvantages.
